# 200 to 50 EMA Cross Over V4 PutHedge

This project implements a trading strategy based on the 200 to 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossover. The strategy aims to identify potential trend reversals in the market and execute put hedge trades accordingly.

One of my earlier experiments with QuantConnect and my systematic trading journey.

Put hedges were too expensive for this strategy as I implemented it. In my opinion a better option would be to go with stop losses or other indicators to try to determine a selling point.
